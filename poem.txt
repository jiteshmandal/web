Ineffable, you are, beyond words to describe,   <br>
            In 'The Art Of Love', you're my cherished vibe. <br><br>

            Your eyes, work magic in my heart,  <br>
            Spectrum, you create with your art. <br><br>

            Your presence, ignites the extinguished candle, <br>
            Lighting the night with your positive vibes,    <br>
            In the serenity, I find, being with you, my soul survives.  <br><br>

            In the tapestry of time, two hearts entwine,    <br>
            In the garden of love, two souls combine.   <br><br>

            You own a place, in my heart,   <br>
            Different and closest, to my soul,  <br>
            In the "Art Of Love", you're my goal.   <br>
